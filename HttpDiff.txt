HTTP:
  The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the 
  foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used 
  to load webpages using hypertext links.This
  allows information transfer between the server 
  and the user inside the web. It is invented in 1989.

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:

1. First version of HTTP is HTTP1.1, developed in 1997 after several
   stages of development were as HTTP2 developed in 2015 to overcome some 
   problems created due to HTTP1.1 version. 

2. HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format, 
   HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, while still 
   maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.

3. HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 

4. HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, 
   it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send 
   multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

5. To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. 
   However, HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called 
   HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets.

6. Compare to HTTP/1.1, factors such as multiplexing, stream prioritization, flow control, 
   server push, and compression in HTTP/2 will affect the changing landscape of web development.
