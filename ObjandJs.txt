Object:
-------
* The 'Object' type represents one of JavaScript's data types.

* It is used to store various keyed collections and more 
complex entities in form of Key:Value Pair.

* Objects can be created using the Object() constructor 
or the object initializer. For EX: Object.create();

* In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs, 
where keys are strings (or symbols) and values 
can be of any data type, including other objects.

* The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. 
We can access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
        "objectName.propertyName"

Internal representation in JavaScript:
--------------------------------------
Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to 
represent objects efficiently. One common approach is using a 
hash table or a similar structure to store the objectâ€™s properties 
and their corresponding values. This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
